.SH DESCRIPTION
.B thash will calculate and output file hashes from a list of files.
By default thash calculates the hash value (algorithm to be determined by the value of the -a switch) of a
file or files specified on the command line. thash then outputs, to standard output, each file’s name (with
absolute path) along with a comma separated list of hash values for that file. The command’s behaviour
can be modified through the use of the switches and arguments in the OPTIONS section below.
thash is multithreaded and uses a producer/consumer model for quick and efficient hashing calculations.
The main process (the producer) populates a queue of file names to be hashed. A number of consumer
threads (2 by default) read file names (actually, the absolute path to a file) from the queue and calculate
the hash value of those files and print the values to standard output.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-a " ALGORITHMS, " \-\-a\falgorithms  " ALGORITHMS " \fR
Hash the files using any of the following hashing algorithms, separated by commas: md5, sha1, sha256,
sha512. See EXAMPLES section for sample usage.
.TP
.BR \-f " FILE, " \-\-file " FILE "\fR
File paths of files to be hashed are to be read, one per line, from the specified file.
.TP
.BR \-e " FILE, " \-\-error " FILE "\fR
Output errors to FILE.
.TP
.BR \-o " FILE, " \-\-output " FILE "\fR
Output the comma separated list of file names and hashes to FILE.
.TP
.BR \-t " NUM, " \-\-threads " NUM "\fR
Number of threads to spawn to run program (default is 2.)

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
thash -a md5 -e errors.txt ~/myfile1 ~/myfile2

Hash two files specified on the command line using md5 
and outputting errors to a file.

.TP
thash -a sha1,sha512 -f ~/filelist.txt -t 2

Hash a list of files read from a text file using sha1 and sha512 using 2 threads.

.TP
thash -a md5,sha1 -f ~/inputfile -o ~/outputfile -t 4

Hash a list of files read from a file using md5 and sha1, using 4 threads and writing output to a
file.

.SH SAMPLE EXECUTION COMMAND AND OUTPUT
